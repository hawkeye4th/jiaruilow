	            	<h6>Posted 11/18/2018</h6>

	            <div class="article">
	            	<p>The blog is mainly about our experiences during our months of relationships, well our first 4 months, of our time while being in a relationship are fun and interesting. It shows our ups, downs, memories, moments, and hardships together. Simply put, this blog mainly shows the things we went through during those moments; a culmination of our memories.</p>
	            	<p>On Late December 31 of 2017 was the first time we met each other. We came from different schools, with some different aspirations, but all with the same goal of getting through primary. There were, at the start, I ask Jia to be my girlfriend It was very awkward at first because I dont really mean to say it Its like a play only but the times goes by all that talk we did, the play we did, the laugh we made, and etc. I started falling inlove with her like really fall inlove I started thinking of her everyday, wants to know more about her, and etc. . Surprisingly, I didn't know that Jia have a boyfriend before then I ask her are you in a relationship? Then she says No then I ask her can you be my girlfiend? Im like blushing as hail and i grab my pillow to cover my face Im like literally OMGOMG then she say sure I was like IS THIS FOR REAL!? O-O Then I promised myself that I'll do anything that will make her happy We were happy, unruly, and sometimes downright crazy, but that just showed how close even if it was only the first few month.</p>
	            	<p>Few months later... 2018 of September came around I cried when I heard that she wont be playing nor chat with me when she reach P6 I cant accept the fact that I wont see her, or play with her ;c because I am scared that something bad will happen to her or she might get bored of me because our relationship will become passive which leads to break ups which is I dont want to happen. Later that day, We fight about it I shouted at her and stuff on why wont she play or chat with me even twice or thrice per week and She says, because I need to focus on my studies and I'll get very busy I exploded that time and says If that person is important to you will give atleast a spare time to him/her after mostly an hour fighting I gaved up I think on what to do. The next morning I realized that I was being selfish I didn't even think that Its good for her So I message her and say Sorry for all the hurtful words I've said. She forgives me... :D. </p>
	            	<p>October and November are here happy things and sad things comes in our life. The happy things is that she passed on p5 but the bad thing is that her parents caught us... Her parents restricted her insta, safari, app store and yt but few days later her dad unrestricted the safari and yt. Im so sooo sad that time when I heard that I need to wait 1 year and 2 months in order for her to use her instagram again... So  I make a poem for her "Jia Rui Low I never ever let you go, I love you to my deepest heart says Art. We might be far from each other but our love stays together, I know Its not easy so our love will be greasy. Im scared of the day that I will lose you someday. All I can do is cry and say Goodbye. But I wont think on that way because Im still your bae. I will make you happy like I am your daddy because you are my baby I will take care if you carefully and love you fully. Dont worry about the bully I will make him/her feel sorry. Jia Rui I already give myself to you I hope my wish will came true, If the destiny is not friendly then It might be the time to let you go I know it will hurt me but all I want is to see you smile."" </p>
	            	<p>If I were to be honest, as a writer, it’d be a huge disservice to not write about everything that happened during the past months, but as it’d be better since it would be in to much detail. Our relationship has truly gone through many things, despite only knowing each other for such a short time. Our relationship has truly bonded over the short period of time, but most of all, our relationship has memories to share for stories to hear.</p>
